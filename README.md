# Liftify  Project 🏋️‍♂️

## Purpose and Motive 💪

**Liftify** is an app that tracks the progress of people who go to the gym and workout. The progress will be tracked through the inputs of personal records for different kind of lifts and display the users workout routine for each day of the week. 🗓️

I was motivated to create this project because this is an application I would personally use. I have gone to the gym for 2 years now, and I have a bad habit of not tracking my exact numbers for personal records so this application would allow to me focus on my goals and guide my workouts.🔩



**Main Uses:** 💡

- Track personal records and put them in categories of push, pull, or legs
- Create workout routines
- Show schedule of workouts
